# Ishagaki Spec

## What is this?
[Inspec](https://www.inspec.io/) is a server configuration testing and spec framework -
 similar to Rspec, but intended to check that servers comply to a specification.

Ishigaki Spec is an Inspec profile containing specs/tests for checking that the [Ishigaki
 Shibboleth IdP container](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki) is built correctly. It can be reused to check that
 containers based on Ishigaki have been built correctly, or even check that independent projects are 
 Ishigaki Spec compatible.
